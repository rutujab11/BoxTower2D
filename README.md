# BoxTower2D
A basic 2D game developed in Unity

Working of the game:
On starting the game, a box hovers on top and a platform is present at the bottom of the screen.
The box falls freely on mouse click. The user can control when the box should fall so that it lands correctly on the platform. Boxes can be stacked up so on to build a tower.
If the box is not able to land on the platform or on the previously stacked up boxes, the game ends and is programmed to be restarted
